- Excel (optional, for initial data cleaning)

### MySQL Setup
1. Install MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench.
2. Create a new database in MySQL Workbench.
3. Import the cleaned CSV file into the database using the MySQL Workbench Import Wizard.

### Python Setup (Optional)
If you want to perform data cleaning using Python, install the necessary libraries:
